Fixed Bugs
----------

- SSH fingerprint confirmation dialog: show as Base64 encoded SHA-256 (as this is the information published by, e.g., GitHub)
    set low-level property ssh.fingerprint.sha256 to false to see the old MD5-hex hash
- Standard window:
    - My History, All Branches + Tags: clicking a ref should scroll it into view if already selected, but not visible

- Standard window:
    - drag and drop is more strict about dragging a ref or commit (similar to the context menu)

- Preferences:
    - for the Standard window the features can be limited to not overwhelm Git newbies

    - targets non-tech users or simple workflows (e.g. single or feature branches)
    - more restricted workflows than in other windows to prevent common pitfalls
    - rather "there is just one way to do something" than "you can do something anytime"
    - support for single-remote (central) repositories only
    - strict separation between working tree (Local Changes) and graph (History) with smart switching between both
    - modes for operations on local branches (My History), checkout/search other branches/tags (All Branches + Tags), see stash details (Stashes) or find historic commits (Reflog)
    - reveal refs on single-click, in My History a delayed second click reveals remote/tracked branch
    - repositories open in tabs
